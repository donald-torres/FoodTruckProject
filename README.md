# FoodTruckProject

### Overview

   This Program is a simulation of a food truck rating app, as only five trucks may be entered. The user enters a name of a food truck they have been to and the food type they serve, they then enter a rating from one to five stars.  When the user is done inputting trucks they move on to a second menu where they have a list of options to choose from.  They then enter a number between 1 and 4 to select what they woulf like to do. The program ends when they choose to quit.

### Technologies / Techniques Used

 - Java
 - Loops
 - Switches
 - Arrays
 - Method calling and Constructors

### How To Run

   Once running the user will be prompted to input a food truck name. Then they will need to enter the type of food they served. Lastly they will be asked to rate the truck entered from one to five stars.  The user will begin the loop again asking for another truck.  Once the user is done with trucks or inputs five truck they can type quit to move on.  The next menu will pop up asking what the user wants to do next.  The options are, view all food trucks, view the average rating of trucks, view the highest rated truck, and to quit, numbered from one to four. Depending on the opition the user wants the program will display the information the user requested.  When done the user will input the number four and end the program.

### Lessons Learned

 Pros -

  - I learned the use of entities for making an information source for a main program.

  - Switches can be utilized to clean up code with the combination of methods.

  - How to use for if statement with arrays to retrieve only input information and avoid crashes due to null information.

  Cons -

  - Overthought creating an incrementing number for the trucks,  I started with a random number generator but it would print the same number. I then simplified it and had trouble getting it to save the previous input and print it.  It was the very last thing I completed it with the use of costructors and adding a variable.

  - Overthinking things slowed me down getting the program to print the highest rating.  I felt that I could have simplified the code initially I added 5 new variables to save it and it worked so I left it, but later realized that i didn't need two of them and cleaned up unnecessary variables.
